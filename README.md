## Contribution:

Please report bugs and request features [here](https://github.com/patuwwy/ShaderToy-Chrome-Plugin/issues).

Please add issue with description before PR.

## Features:

-   **Custom parameters** -
    [See documentation](./docs/custom-params.md)

-   **Fork** any shader.

-   **GPU render timers** (EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2).

-   Adjustable slider for **full control of 'iTime'** uniform and audio/video channels' time.

-   Save as new draft (for owned shaders).

-   Four sliders for **simulating mouse position**.
    This can be used to tweaking variables with iMouse.xyzw uniform.

-   ~~Switchable dark color theme.~~
    (feature removed - implemented natively in Shadertoy)

-   ~~Sorting shaders list by views, likes or comments on "My profile" page.~~
    (feature removed - implemented natively in Shadertoy)

-   Alternative shaders list on profile page. ~~(chrome only)~~

-   ~~Shaders previews on "My profile" page.~~
    (feature removed - implemented natively in Shadertoy. Big preview on mouse over is still available)

-   **Change resolution** in windowed and fullscreen mode by pressing keys ALT + 1...9.

    Resolution is divided by pressed key value, for example:

    Key '2' divides by 2, 1920x1080 becomes 960x540.
    Key '8' divides by 8, 1920x1080 becomes 240x135.

    This allows to run shaders smoothly (even in fullscreen) on non-top GPUs.
    ~~Notice that lower resolution is interpolated to original size. This causes blurrish rendering.~~
    Notice, antialiasing is enabled by default on Shadertoy WebGL canvas.
    For "pixelated" image, rendering mode switch has been added in extension's popup (click on green S icon) ~~(chrome only)~~.

-   Take HQ screenshot. Screenshot resolution is 2 \* current resolution (including current resolution divider). 1920x1080 becomes 3840x2160.

-   Pause/Restart in fullscreen mode.

-   Fullscreen edit mode.

-   **Export shaders** (single JSON or ZIP archive with JSON and readme.txt).

-   Import JSON.

-   **Show links** in description/comments even if not inserted with BBCode.

-   ~~Show current canvas resolution~~ ~~on FPS hover~~
    (feature removed - implemented natively in Shadertoy)

-   **Render call multiplier**.

-   **Loop** in set time range (including video/audio channels).

-   **Open recent** - Quick access to recently viewed own shaders.

-   Shader preview (automatic generated image).

-   **Code completion** for glsl keywords in the code editor.

-   **Color picker** for any vec3 with r,g,b values in the code editor.
